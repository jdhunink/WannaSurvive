# WannaSurvive

Status: In Progress

WannaSurvive is a backup software built with the sole purpose of trying to defeat the Ransomware encrpytion of backup drives. 
The software is designed using a clever workaround to how the majority of ransomware viruses 
work to target your machines and attached hard drives. By writing a mounting and demounting script, 
external backup drives will only be mounted with drive letters when a backup is being performed. Therefore if 
ransomware strikes, the attached backup drives will not be mapped and therefore undiscoverable by the ransomware. Defeating 
the encryption of your backup drives
